##Quran Ayah Analyzer - AI-Powered Research Tool | Complete Quranic Database with Custom Fields
📝 Description
Assalamu Alaikum!
In this Project, I'm sharing a powerful n8n automation workflow that helps researchers analyze the entire Quran ayah by ayah with custom data fields that aren't available anywhere on the internet.
🎯 Who is this for?

Researchers studying the Quran
Anyone needing a custom Quran database
People analyzing Quranic patterns and mathematics
Scholars looking for topic-wise categorization of verses

✨ What does this automation do?
This workflow analyzes each Quranic verse and extracts:

Topics - What subjects each ayah relates to (Science, Biology, Physics, Astrophysics, etc.)
Types - Category classification of verses
Word Count - Total words in each ayah
Letter Count - Total Arabic letters
Dot Count - Diacritical dots (for mathematical pattern analysis)
Word Array - Complete word breakdown
Repeated Words - Identification of repeated words
Unique Words - Count of unique words

🛠️ How it works:

Form triggers to select Surah and processing mode (Whole Surah or Custom Range)
Fetches authentic Arabic text from Al-Quran Cloud API (Free)
AI analyzes the text using custom prompts (Google Gemini)
Structured data is automatically saved to Google Sheets
Export as CSV for further analysis in Python or any tool

📊 Two Automation Options:

Surah-by-Surah - For testing and specific chapters (Active in demo)
Full Quran - Processes all 6,236 verses at once (Currently inactive)

🎨 Customization:
You can modify:

AI prompts to extract different fields
Google Sheet columns to save custom data
Analysis parameters based on your research needs

💡 Use Cases:

Finding how many verses relate to specific scientific topics
Mathematical pattern analysis of the Quran
Creating topic-wise Quran databases
Comparative studies across surahs
Custom research projects
Explain this ayah using 3 different tafseer in English, structured as: Context → Message → Application
