# Quran-Ayah-Analyzer
This n8n automation workflow processes Quranic verses (ayahs) and performs comprehensive linguistic analysis using AI. It extracts Arabic text from the Al-Quran Cloud API, analyzes each verse for word patterns, letter counts, diacritical dots, and thematic categorization, then stores the results in a Google Sheet database.
